# Git Hashing Exercise
Assignment 04 of the Operating Systems Course.

## Description

A simple bash script that generates a hash for a user-defined 4-digit integer. The result is saved in a file named hash_output.txt

## Assignment Instructions

* Create a new folder named GitHashingExcercise. Create a text file named README.md in your repository and write a brief description (a few words) of the project.
* Generate a unique 4-digit integer, i.e. by using the last 4 digits of your academic ID (AEM).
* Create a script in a shell of your choice named hash_script and output a hash of the input. You can use any standard hashing algorithm (like SHA-256). Run the script with your unique 4-digit integer and save the output in a file name hash_output.txt
* Use git commands to add and commit hash_script and hash_output.txt to your local repository. Lastly, create a new public repository named GitHashingExcercise on github.com and push your local commits to the remote repository.
